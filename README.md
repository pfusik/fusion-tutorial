# Tutorial and Code examples for the Fusion Programming Language

The [Fusion programming language](https://www.fusion-lang.org/) allows you to
write code which can be transpiled to code for other programming languages
like C, C++, Java and others. The generated C or C++ code can be then used in
scripting languages like Tcl, R or others using the
[Simplified Warapper and Interface Generator (Swig)](https://swig.org). 

Below you see a list of programming languages which you can target directly
using using the [fut - command line tool for Fusion](https://github.com/fusionlanguage/fut/)
or, indirectly, using the C or C++ generated code and swig.

## Example

Here the classical "Hello World" example:

```csharp
public class Hello
{
    public static string GetMessage()
    {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```

The folder [samples/hello](samples/hello) contains a Makefile which shows how
to translate this code into these various programming languages as well as
one example to use Swig to generate a Tcl library based on the Fusion output.

## Python example

If you write the code above into a file Hello.fu you can translate this file into a python file like this:

```
fut Hello.fu -o hello.py
```

The content of that file would then look like this:

```python
# Generated automatically with "fut". Do not edit.

class Hello:

	@staticmethod
	def get_message() -> str:
		"""Returns a greeting message."""
		return "Hello, world!"

```

The Fusion language is not meant to be used to write applications directly.
You can do this as well if you will. For an example on how to this, see later. However, it is focused on
writing libraries which can be then used within the mentioned languages. To
test the example code above you can create a little file which contains code
to use the generated Python file with following content.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import hello
h=hello.Hello()
print(h.get_message())
```

So the full procedure to create and run the Python code is as follows:

```bash
fut -o hello.py Hello.fu
python3 hello.py
```

## C example

Similarly, you can transpile the Fu-file into a C-file like this:

```
fut Hello.fu -o hello.c
```

This will create two files "hello.c" and "hello.h".


To run the generated method in a C program you again might create a C file
with a main function like this:

```c
// file: run-hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "hello.h"

int main (int argc, char * argv[]) {
    printf("%s\n",Hello_GetMessage());
    return(0);
}
```

You can then compile your _fut_ generated hello files and the run-hello.c file
to an executable like this:

```bash
gcc hello.c run-hello.c -o hello
```

## Tcl example

Using the Swig tools we can as well take the generated C or C++ code and wrap
this into a Tcl, R, Perl, Ruby or many other language libraries by creating a Swig interface file which looks like
this:


```
%{
#include "hello.h"
%}
%include "hello.h"
```

The pipeline to create and test the code using a shared library on a Debian
system then looks like this for a example for the Tcl programming language:

```bash
fut -o tcl/hello.c Hello.fu                     ## gnerate hello.c and hello.h
swig -tcl8 -module hello hello.i                ## create the interface C code
gcc -fPIC -c hello.c                            ## compile the FU generated code
gcc -fPIC -c hello_wrap.c -I/usr/include/tcl8.6 ## compile the SWIG generated code
gcc -shared hello.o hello_wrap.o -o hello.so    ## combine both to a Tcl library
echo "load ./hello.so; puts [Hello_GetMessage];" | tclsh    ## execute the code using Tcl
```

## Other Language Examples

The file [samples/hello/Makefile](samples/hello/Makefile) contains as well
examples to translate and compile the `Hello.fu` file show above to C++, C-
sharp, D, Java, Javascript and Swift programs.

## Standalone applications

Even if the main target of the Fusion language is writing libraries you can
write for testing purposes as well simple standalone applications to test
directly your code. This then does not require to create a second file to run
the library code as shown above. Our "Hello World!" example show above would
look then like this:

```csharp
// file Main.fu
public static class Main {
    public static void Main () {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }   
}
```

That file can be then transpiled and executed as a Python program like this:

```bash
fut -o main.py Main.fu 
python3 main.py 
Hello World!
```

The generated output file main.py looks like this:

```python
# Generated automatically with "fut". Do not edit.

class Main:

	@staticmethod
	def main() -> None:
		print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
	Main.main()

```

You can as well execute this translation as an one liner:

```bash
fut -o main.py Main.fu && cat main.py | python3 
Hello World!
```

Using Python as the target language allows for fast development without compilation steps.

## Tutorial

There is a more extensive tutorial as a WIP project which you can view here

## See Also

Here are two other programming languages which transpile to several different programming languages

- [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) - C++ and Java like language transpiles to C++, C-sharp, JVM, PHP, Lua, Python, Neko
- [Temper](https://temperlang.dev/) - C++ and Java like language - transpiles to C-sharp, Java, Javascript/Typescript, Python, Lua
- [Wax](https://github.com/LingDong-/wax) - Lisp like language - transpiles to C, Java, Typecript, Python, C-sharp, Swift, Lua 

The main advantage of Fusion seems the easy to learn language, clear and
small implementation, install size less than 1Mb and the targeting of C in an object oriented style usable with Swig.

The main disadvantage seems to be the smaller core library, fewer string or list functions for instance, but due to the small install
size this is just the prize to pay. We can implement however missing functionalities by using  _native_ blocks to add more features.

## Summary

The Fusion programming language allows you to implement libraries and
algorithms usable for a lot of widely used programming languages in a C-sharp
like syntax. The syntax is therefor easy to comprehend for many programmers.
Using the Swig interface generator even more languages like scripting
languages such as Tcl, Perl, Lua or Octave or languages like Go can be
targeted.
